D3.js v4 for Sublime Text 3
===========================

This is a collection of code completions and snippets to make working with and learning [D3.js][D3js] a little easier and quicker.


## Featuring: ##

* Code completions and context menu for the entire D3.js library.
	* The context menu is organized to match D3's [API Reference][D3-Docs] and is accessible by right-click, two-finger tap, or ctrl+click.
	* Example:

		![Context Menu Screenshot](./Resource/context.menu.example.png)


* code snippets for the changes from v3 to v4.
	* Accessible from the command pallette (Mac: Cmd+Shift+P, Windows: Ctrl+Shift+P).
	* Typing a v3 command or partial string will suggest the v4 equivalent.

* convenience snippets of commonly used features of D3.js 



Please let me of any typos, if anything is missing, or of any requests for convenience snippets to be added.
