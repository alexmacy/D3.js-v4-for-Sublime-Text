D3.js v4 for Sublime Text 3
===========================

A collection of code dompletions and snippets to make working with D3.js a little easier and quicker.

## Featuring:
* code completions for the entire version 4 of D3.js library.

* code snippets for the changes from v3 to v4.
	* Accessible from the command pallette (Mac: Cmd+Shift+P, Windows: Ctrl+Shift+P)
	* Typing a v3 command or partial string will suggest the v4 equivalent.

* convenience snippets of commonly used features of D3.js 

Please let me of any typos, if anything is missing, or of any requests for convenience snippets to be added.

This is partially an update to [fabriciotav](https://github.com/fabriciotav)'s Sublime Text 2 plug-in, [D3.js snippets for Sublime Text 2](https://github.com/fabriciotav/d3-snippets-for-sublime-text-2)

## Installation:

This will be accessible from within Sublime Text via Package Control, but for now it can be installed by downloading this repo and copying the files directly into Sublime Text's packages folder.

* To find the packages folder:
	* Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/ 
	* Windows: C:\Users\%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages/
